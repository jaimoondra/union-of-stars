# Union-of-Stars with Sparsification and Decomposition

This repository contains the code for
- the union-of-stars algorithm (https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08165) for generating target graph coupling on trapped-ion hardware and
- the sparse union-of-stars algorithm (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14330) that that uses a decomposition and sparsification of the target graph to reduce the number of gates needed to implement the coupling

To see example usage, look at notebooks > examples.

Original union-of-stars algorithm developed by Joel Rajakumar, Jai Moondra, Bryan Gard, Swati Gupta, and Creston D. Herold. Contact Jai Moondra (jmoondra3@gatech.edu) for questions or comments.
